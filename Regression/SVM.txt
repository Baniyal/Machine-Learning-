SVR(support vector regression)
# support vector machines support linear and nonlinear regression that we can refer to as SVR
# performs linear regression in a higher(dimensional space)

SVR has a different regression goal compared to linear regression . In linear regression we
are tryong to minimize the error between the prediction and the data. In SVR our goal is to 
make sure that the errors donot excees the threshold.
