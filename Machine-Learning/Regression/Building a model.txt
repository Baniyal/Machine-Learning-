Backward Elimination : 
#1 select a significance level to stay in the model
#2 fit the full model with possible predictors
#3 consider the predictor with the highest P level:
	if p level > significance level:
		remove the predictor
#4 Fit the model without the preddictor(make the model again without the variable)
------>go to step 3

Forward Selection:
#1 select the significance level
#2 fit all the simple regression models y = x/(n){for the first time its all linear regression models},select the lowest P-value
#3 Keep this variable and fit all possible models{for the first time its regression model with two variables} with one extra predictor added to the one
 you already have
{we keep growing model one step at a time}
#4 consider the predictor with the lowest P value,If pvalue < Significance level to step 3
Otherwise go to finish ( stopping condition is when variable added is having P value > significance level)
FIN: Keep the previous model

Bi directional Elimination
#1 Select a significance level
#2 preform forward selection(new variables must have p < Significance level to enter)
#3 preform ALL the steps of Backward elimination (p< significance level to stay)
GOTO STEP 2 untill
#4 No new variables can enter and no old variables can exit
