decison tree is a decision supporting tool used for classification and regression alike.

A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node 
represents a “test” on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails),
 each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label 
(decision taken after computing all attributes).
 The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules.

decision tree algorithms are referred to as CART(classification and Regression Trees)

Decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm (having a pre-defined target variable) 
that is mostly used in classification problems. It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. In this technique, 
we split the population or sample into two or more homogeneous sets (or sub-populations)
based on most significant splitter / differentiator in input variable.
